# Contributing to Ormedian

Thanks for taking interest in contributing.

## How to contribute
- **Bugs:** open an issue with steps to reproduce and expected vs actual behaviour.
- **Features:** open an issue describing the use case and why it matters.
- **Docs:** improvements are very welcome — clarity beats cleverness.

## Contribution principles
- Prefer small PRs with a clear purpose
- Reproducibility matters (describe environment and steps)
- Add minimal tests/examples where appropriate (when code exists)

## Communication
Please use GitHub Issues first; Discussions for broader questions.
